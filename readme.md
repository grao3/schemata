# GRAO3
GraphQL Archive of our Own (abbreviated _GRAO3_, preferred pronunciation "gray-oh-three") is a fan archive much like the [Archive of our Own](archiveofourown.org/), but using a different technology stack. _Please do not take this too seriously;_ I have no intention that this project becomes some sort of competitor to the Archive, nor any expectation that the Archive will borrow a single line of code I write here. I'm doing this to teach myself some new(-ish) technologies; in particular, I'm getting used to [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Ladle](https://ladle.dev/) for tooling, and taking a try at [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react).

But even if the point of this project is purely educational, I still want to give GAO3 the best possible user experience. If you see a bug or have a suggestion, please feel free to open an issue in the appropriate repository. Currently, this project is spread across


- **[grao3/schemata]**, this repository, which contains definitions of the types and queries in the archive's graphql API.
